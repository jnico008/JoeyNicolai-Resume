        <p class="lead mb-4">Hello! My name is Joey Nicolai and I grew up in Orange County, CA and raised in a house of women with two sisters and my mom! I am currently a sophomore Student-Athlete here at the University of California Riverside and here is a little bit about me. My Major here at UC Riverside is Media and Cultural Studies and a second year undergraduate. Two years before this I graduated Mater Dei High School in 2019 as I attended there the entire four years. I also played baseball at Mater Dei which led me to find a spot here at UCR. Baseball has been a part of my entire life and currently it is also my full time job as it takes all free time away. With that being said, the game of baseball has taught me many valuable lessons in life I would not be able to find anywhere else. The sport has grown me into the energetic, outgoing, and competitive young man I am today, but I learn something new everyday, especially from my mistakes. I am a big competitor and have many things to learn still, but I know I will be able to handle whatever life throws my way next. <br><br>

        With the pandemic being so crazy and baseball always factoring in my schedule, I have not been able to work and involve myself with the community as much as I would like. Over the summers I will usually get involved with summer baseball camps and help give back as much to the game as it has given me. Working those camps arenâ€™t just for helping kids get better, but the camps also allow me to check myself as being a better person and player. I got my first real job when I was 17 and I worked on the Balboa Island Ferry. I feel I am very outgoing and so I loved working on the Balboa Ferry because I was able to talk to everyone who came on and listen to whatever they wanted to talk about. Usually they were tourists, and I was from the area so I knew of places they would want to go to. If they wanted food ideas, I would give them plenty of options and really just had fun with it. The next job I had was I would work at the Camp James Summer Camp in the Newport Dunes. This was one of the most fun jobs I have ever had. I was one of the main coordinators for the camp counselors, and basically ran the activities and the sign up. This job was over the summer and allowed me to work with many great kids who were always full of energy and excitement everyday which I absolutely love.<br><br>

        Overall, I feel as I am very unique and would love to make a difference and positive impact wherever Iâ€™m led to next. The journey I am currently taking is nowhere near finished, but I will never know when the next obstacle is thrown my way.
